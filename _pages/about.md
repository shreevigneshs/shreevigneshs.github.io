I am a passionate NLP researcher currently pursuing graduate studies at University Of California, Santa Cruz. Previously I was working at Goldman Sachs Data Science and Machine Learning (erst.while Research & Development Engineering) team on a variety of problems in the space of information retrieval and extraction from rich and densely packed financial and legal documents. I have built tools to improve the readability of these documents by incorporating deeper structured search for better navigation. 

I feel in today's society though everyone has access to plethora of data (be it textual, audio or visual), not everyone has the time, the requisite skillset nor the cognitive bandwidth to consume such massive volumes. I research in this space and build intelligent systems to help distill information relevant to one's experience and enrich societies knowledge pool.

I have had the good fortune of working with <a href="http://www.saraswat.org/" class="uline">Dr. Vijay Saraswat</a>, <a href="https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~corrogg/" class="uline">Dr. Luciano Del Corro</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eliotpbrenner/" class="uline">Dr. Eliot Brenner</a>, <a href="https://www.hoffart.ai/" class="uline">Dr. Johannes Hoffart</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/disoulio/" class="uline">Dimitrios Soulis.
